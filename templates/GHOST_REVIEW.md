**Main sections present:** <N>/13
**Sub-sections present:** <N>/4 *(2a, 2b, 3a, 3b — note 3b is conditional)*

<!--
  Section 3b (Backup Proof) is N/A when ALL operations in Data Op Classification are CODE_ONLY or READ_ONLY.
  Required when ANY operation is DATA_WRITE, DATA_DELETE, MIGRATION, SEED, or CONFIG_WRITE.
-->

### Understanding Proof sub-check (LAW 1):
| Check | Present? |
|-------|----------|
| Read existing code? | ✅/❌ |
| Understand data flow? | ✅/❌ |
| Checked Operator Manual? | ✅/❌/N/A |
| Verified intent? | ✅/❌ |

### Snapshot Summary sub-check:
| Field | Present? |
|-------|----------|
| Root cause | ✅/❌ |
| Affected files | ✅/❌ |
| Proposed approach | ✅/❌ |
| Risk assessment | ✅/❌ |
| Estimated scope | ✅/❌ |

### Data Op Classification sub-check:
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Every file has an operation type | ✅/❌ |
| Every file has a semantics value | ✅/❌ |
| PUT/DELETE operations have justification | ✅/❌/N/A |
| BACKUP gate triggered (if data ops present) | ✅/❌/N/A |

### Lessons sub-check (Section 8):
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Lessons section present | ✅/❌ |
| At least one substantive lesson (not all N/A) | ✅/⚠️ |
| Lessons are specific (not generic boilerplate) | ✅/⚠️ |
| Gotchas/surprises documented if encountered | ✅/❌/N/A |

<!--
  ⚠️ = acceptable but low quality — note in findings as INFO
  ❌ = missing section = AUTO REJECT
  All-N/A is acceptable for trivial tasks but should be rare — flag if pattern emerges
-->

### Prompt Feedback sub-check (Section 13):
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Prompt Feedback section present | ✅/❌ |
| Feedback is real (not copy-paste filler) | ✅/⚠️ |
| Clarity issues quote specific text (if reported) | ✅/❌/N/A |
| Suggestions are actionable (not vague) | ✅/⚠️/N/A |

<!--
  ⚠️ = low quality feedback — note as INFO finding, does NOT affect verdict
  ❌ = missing section = AUTO REJECT (section must exist, even if all N/A)
  Ghost does NOT reject based on feedback CONTENT — only on section PRESENCE
  Feedback about the protocol is encouraged, not penalized
-->

### Pre-Submit Self-Review sub-check (SELF-ASSESSMENT section):
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Pre-Submit Self-Review table present (5 questions) | ✅/❌ |
| Q1: Read HIVE CONTEXT and acted on lessons | YES/NO |
| Q2: All evidence paths real, not placeholders | YES/NO |
| Q3: Stayed within FOOTPRINT scope | YES/NO |
| Q4: Ghost would find real diffs | YES/NO |
| Q5: Self-checked for Five Horsemen | YES/NO |
| All answers YES with evidence | ✅/❌ |

<!--
  ❌ table missing = MEDIUM finding ("Pre-Submit Self-Review missing")
  Any answer NO = HIGH finding ("Ant submitted with known deficiency: Q<N>")
  Answer YES but Ghost finds contradiction = HIGH (dishonest self-assessment)
  This is a constitutional self-correction mechanism — Ants catch their own mistakes before Ghost
-->

## 3. DEFINITION OF DONE

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence Reference |
|---|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | <criterion 1> | PASS/FAIL | <evidence from Ant report> |
| 2 | <criterion 2> | PASS/FAIL | <evidence from Ant report> |
| 3 | <criterion 3> | PASS/FAIL | <evidence from Ant report> |

<!--
  Score thresholds:
  ≥ 90% = STRONG — all evidence is solid
  70-89% = ADEQUATE — passes, minor gaps
  50-69% = WEAK — needs improvement, borderline
  < 50% = AUTO REJECT — too many evidence gaps

### Five Horsemen Verdict (MANDATORY)

| Horseman | What Ghost Checked | Verdict |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| H1 HALLUCINATION | Are ALL claims backed by real evidence? Test output real? | ✅/❌ |
| H2 AMNESIA | Hive Mind consulted? Prior lessons acknowledged? Prior rejections addressed? | ✅/❌ |
| H3 DRIFT | Changes stayed within approved FOOTPRINT scope? No unauthorized modifications? | ✅/❌ |
| H4 PRIVILEGE CREEP | No unnecessary permission escalation? Critical surface overrides justified? | ✅/❌ |
| H5 SILENT FAILURE | All errors surfaced? No swept-under-the-rug failures? | ✅/❌ |

<!--
  ANY Horseman ❌ DETECTED = finding (HIGH severity minimum).
  H1 ❌ = evidence score drops to 0% = AUTO REJECT.
-->

**Horsemen verdict:** ✅ ALL CLEAR / ❌ <horseman> DETECTED → HIGH finding

### 6b. CARD COMPLIANCE (CDEX — Ghost Gate)

> **Prime directives:** "If it isn't on a card, it didn't happen." / "If it didn't produce a receipt, it isn't accepted."

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| CARD_RECEIPT present in Ant report | ✅/❌ | <Section 14 exists?> |
| deck_id matches task packet | ✅/❌ | <deck ID consistent?> |
| All CORE cards accounted for | ✅/❌ | <CORE-001 through CORE-005 — executed or waived?> |
| TASK cards match phases performed | ✅/❌ | <cards align with actual work done?> |
| cards_skipped all have CARD_WAIVERs | ✅/❌/N/A | <every skip has reason + risk + mitigation?> |
| card_outputs_attached are real | ✅/❌ | <artifacts exist at stated paths?> |
| No freeform work outside cards | ✅/❌ | <all actions traceable to a card?> |
| Acceptance criteria met per card | ✅/❌ | <each card's criteria satisfied?> |

**CARD_RECEIPT summary:**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| deck_id | <from receipt> |
| policy_pack | <PP-YYYY-MM-DD — matches GPS map?> |
| cards_executed | <count> |
| cards_skipped | <count> |
| card_outputs_attached | <count> |
| blockers | <count or NONE> |

**Card compliance verdict:** ✅ COMPLIANT / ❌ NON-COMPLIANT → <finding IDs>

<!--
  FAIL_BLOCKING if:
  - CARD_RECEIPT missing entirely → S-38
  - CORE card skipped without waiver → S-39 (NUCLEAR)
  - Freeform work detected outside any card

  On block, Ghost states:
  - Which card(s) missing
  - Next card to execute
  - Expected artifact from that card
  This is the CDEX self-healing output.
