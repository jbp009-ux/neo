## COMPLETED RUNS

<!--
  BECCA appends a new entry here each time a run is VERIFIED and CLOSED.
  Entries are in chronological order (newest at bottom).
  This file is the project's institutional memory — BECCA reads it during
  RECON to understand what was done before and make better decisions.

  Each entry contains:
  - Run number and date
  - Task count and ID range
  - Brief summary of what was accomplished
  - Archive location of the completed TODO
  - Verdict (VERIFIED / VERIFIED WITH NOTES)
-->

## NOTES

<!--
  BECCA can add cross-run observations here:
  - Recurring patterns across runs
  - Areas that needed multiple fixes
  - Operator decisions that affect future runs
  - Known technical debt carried forward

  Example:
  - auth/ directory has been touched in 3 of 5 runs — consider dedicated hardening pass
  - Operator deferred MEDIUM findings in runs 002 and 003 — may accumulate
  - Test coverage gaps in payments/ flagged by Inspector in runs 001, 004
