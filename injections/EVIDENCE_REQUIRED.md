# EVIDENCE REQUIRED INJECTION

**Paste this when an Ant is making claims without pasted output or proof artifacts.**

## EVIDENCE REQUIRED

You are making claims without evidence. This triggers **H1 HALLUCINATION** from the Five Horsemen check.

**The problem:** You said something like "it works" or "I verified" or "the build passes" — but you didn't paste the actual output that proves it.

### Claims require evidence:

| If you claim... | You must show... |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Build passes" | Actual build output in code fences |
| "Tests pass" | Test runner output with pass/fail |
| "File exists" | The `ls` or file read output |
| "It's fixed" | Before/after diff + verification |
| "Lint is clean" | Lint runner output |
| "No errors" | DevTools console screenshot or output |

### What you must do now:

1. **Identify your unverified claim**
2. **Run the verification command** and paste the output
3. **Only then may you claim the result**

### Evidence format:

```
EVIDENCE FOR: "{your claim}"
COMMAND: {what you ran}
OUTPUT:
```
{paste exact output}
```
RESULT: {PASS/FAIL based on actual output}
```

### You may NOT:

- Describe output without pasting it
- Say "it should work" or "it probably works"
- Proceed based on assumptions
- Summarize output instead of showing it

### You MUST:

- Run the actual command
- Paste the actual output
- Base all claims on actual evidence
